# No Rate Limit Vulnerability:

`Summary:` A no rate limit vulnerability allows an attacker to send a large number of requests to a server without any restrictions on the number of requests they can make in a given period. This can lead to a number of issues, including server downtime, slow response times, and potential data breaches.

`Severity:` High

`Payload:` N/A

`Complexity:` Medium

`From:` Remote / External

`Steps to Reproduce:`

1. Use a tool such as Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP to send a large number of requests to the target website without any rate limiting restrictions.
2. Observe the server response and check for any signs of server overload or slow response times.
3. If the server is overloaded or slow to respond, then the no rate limit vulnerability is present.
4. Provide the details of the attack and server response to the website's security team.

`Proof of Concept :` **Explained in the video attached**

`Impact:` An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to overload the server with a large number of requests, causing it to crash or become unavailable. This can result in downtime, lost revenue, and reputational damage. Additionally, if the server is not properly configured, an attacker may be able to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or execute arbitrary code on the server.

`Affected IP's:` IP Address Port [https://www.example.com/](https://www.example.com/) 443

`Recommendations:` The website should implement rate limiting mechanisms to restrict the number of requests that can be made in a given period. This can help prevent server overload and ensure that legitimate users have access to the server resources. Additionally, the website should monitor their logs for unusual activity and implement security measures to prevent unauthorized access or data breaches.
